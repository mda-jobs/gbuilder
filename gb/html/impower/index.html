    THE SOVEREIGN CITIZEN by: Judge Dale, retired<br> Thursday, 11 April 2013</p>
  <p>
    Our federal government has instructed our federal, state and local police agencies that <a href="https://anticorruptionsociety.com/2010/04/18/leading-the-fbi-down-the-path/">everyone who purports to be a SOVEREIGN should be TREATED as a TERRORIST!</a> They have also brainwashed the American public into believing that being a SOVEREIGN is anti-American and unpatriotic! Perhaps this is: “The POT calling the KETTLE black?”</p>
  <p>
      WHAT IS SOVEREIGNTY? It is the inherent right and prerogative of a civilized people to rule itself, and to dictate all of the forms and conditions of the institutions it sets up to carry out this rule. Ironically, the U.S. SUPREME COURT agrees with those people who claim to be SOVEREIGN citizens of the American Republic!</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
        Bond vs. UNITED STATES, 529 US 334 – 2000, The Supreme Court held that the American People are in fact Sovereign and not the States or the Government. The court went on to define that local, state and federal law enforcement officers were committing unlawful actions against the Sovereign People by the enforcement of the laws and are personally liable for their actions.</li>
    <li>
        Bond v. United States, 529 US 334 – 2000 – &lrm;Supreme Court – Cited by 761 litigants in other cases.</li>
    <li>
        Bond v. US, 131 S. Ct. 2355 – 2011 – &lrm;Supreme Court – Cited by 306 “ “</li>
    <li>
        Bond v. US, 1 F. 3d 631 – 1993 – &lrm;Court of Appeals, 7th – Cited by 66 “ “
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    What are the implications of this 2000, U. S. Supreme Court ruling?</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>The delegates to the first Federal Convention prohibited the use of corporations by all governments representing the American Republic.</strong> Therefore, all of these corporate governments and their corporate laws are a usurpation of the organic Constitution of the United States of America. All State Governments are now sub-corporations of the Federal Government, making all Courts and all law enforcement personnel, corporate federal agencies or employees. [See: James Madison Journal of the Federal Convention, Vol. 2, P. 722] and [Pull up your State Code on your PC and search the Code for the words “District of Columbia” and “Federal Government.” You will receive about 1000 references linking your state to the federal government.]</p>
      </li>
    </p>
      <li>
        <strong>The state and federal government is a corporation</strong> and therefore the Congress, State Legislatures, City Councils, Municipalities and all State and Federal Courts are corporate entities posing as Constitutional branches of government.</p>
      <li>
        <strong>Corporations are privately owned businesses</strong>, meaning that the Corporate United States belongs to one or more private individuals, which is always governed by a Board of Directors. The Corporate United States is privately owned by a group of European Royal and Elite individuals tied to the Federal Reserve System and the letters of incorporation are recorded in the Vatican. The President of the United States is actually the CEO of the United States and the Congress and all others are corporate employees. Everything they do is in the interest of the corporate owners! I can’t access those documents because of National Security.</p>
      <li>In order to promulgate and enforce Criminal Laws to govern the SOVEREIGN public, government must be SOVEREIGN too, which is an accepted RULE of LAW derived from the, Ancient Law of Kings. <strong>Corporations are not and can never be SOVEREIGN. They are not real, they are a fiction and only exist on paper.</strong>
    </p>
      <li>
        Therefore, <strong>all laws created by these government corporations are private corporate regulations</strong> called public law, statutes, codes and ordinances to conceal their true nature.&nbsp; Do the Judge and your lawyer know about this? You bet they do!</li>
      <li>
        Since these government bodies are not SOVEREIGN, they cannot promulgate or enforce CRIMINAL LAWS; they can only create and enforce CIVIL LAWS, which are duty bound to comply with the LAW of CONTRACTS. <strong>The Law of Contracts requires signed written agreements</strong> and complete transparency! Did you ever agree to be arrested and tried under any of their corporate statutes? For that matter, did you ever agree to contract with them by agreeing to be sued for violating their corporate regulations?</li>
      <li>
        [Citations and Complaints are contracts but they lack transparency because you were never told what might happen to you if you agree to contract, and that you had a right to refuse the accommodation!]</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Do any of Americas Courts have Jurisdiction over a SOVEREIGN? Yes … but only by your consent</strong> to be judged by the Court. Can they compel [Summon or Subpoena] you to appear or participate in their process? No … they can’t compel you and Yes … they can ask but you can reject the accommodation in writing and nothing can be done about it because you have refused to give the court jurisdiction over you!</li>
      <li>
        <strong> Enforcement of these corporate statutes by local, state and federal law enforcement officers are unlawful actions</strong> being committed against the SOVEREIGN public and these officers can be held personally liable for their actions. [Bond v. U.S., 529 US 334-2000]</li>
      <li>
        There being no Constitutional Criminal Laws or Transparency in the American Justice System, <strong>everyone arrested, convicted and sentenced to prison under these CIVIL LAWS are in prison by CONSENT</strong> and therein, all American Jails are actually DEBTORS PRISONS!</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Most of the County and State Prisons and all of the Federal Prisons are privately owned corporate businesses for profit</strong>, which kick back to the sentencing Judges. The Bureau of Prisons Privatization Management Branch provides general oversight, for these institutions. So if you are convicted in these Courts, you can expect to serve some jail time! Now you know why America has such high prison populations!</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Can the State Government and Courts take Custody of your children? Only with your consent</strong>, otherwise their agents and officers can be held personally liable for their actions! Orphans are a different matter and can become wards of the Court until emancipated.</li>
    </ol>
  <p>
    <strong>Corporate governments are a usurpation of the organic American Constitution and this corporatist onslaught in America has since its creation, been a</strong>n ANTI-SOVEREIGN and <strong>TERRORIST REGIME</strong> and are in fact the real TERRORIST and TRAITORS to the American Republic.</p>

  <h3>How a Mortgage Really Works By Judy Harkins (jharkins@wvi.com)</h3>
  <p>
    Below is an EXCELLENT explanation of how a mortgage works and the bank fraud involved. READ it FIVE TIMES! - LEARN it - UNDERSTAND IT ... then LEARN HOW YOU CAN DO SOMETHING about it! Others are - you can too! (Credit cards work some- what the same way - the figures are only "entries" on the books - the bank never loans you a dime of their money - they can't, they have no money of their own to loan!).
  <p>
    When a mortgage is "created" , it is Your signature on the promissory note that creates the "funds". They did not exist before then! 
  <p>
  <p>
    The promissory note creates an Accounts Receivable with your name on it and that's what you pay month after month after month. (You are actually paying the bank's taxes on the money your promissory note just created for the bank) 
  <p>
    The promissory note also creates an Accounts Payable with your name on it. But you never see that account. It's the account that owes you money. (You just created an asset for the bank and they don't want you to know that!) 
  <p>
    Did the lender give you the money (cash, check??) when You signed the promissory note? Most likely not. They "withheld" it from you. 
  <p>
    The lender/bank then fractionalizes or monetizes your promissory note. (They are allowed to times your note x 10 and sell it!) 
  <p>
    Example: A promissory note for $100,000 becomes $1,000,000 when the bank fractionalizes it. 
  <p>
    The lender/bank also sells your promissory note. This repays their Accounts Receivable in full. They first must endorse vour note assigning to a third party . The Title Page reflects this activity. Thus your Original Wet Ink Signature Note is VOID and unenforceable! [ Fraud ] 
  <p>
    The Accounts Payable is not abandon funds. The bank is suppose to send the borrower an IRS 1099A, Notice of Abandonment, but they don't. [ More Fraud ] (IRS 1099A shows how much money you created for the bank!) 
  <p>
    When you make a monthly payment to the lender/bank, you are actually paying the TAX the bank owes the IRS for the money YOU created, + interest [ Still More Fraud ]
  <p>
    How a mortgages should work - this is what SHOULD happen 
    <ul>
      <li>
        You sign a promissory note and the bank gives you the "money" (cash or check or money order)</li>
      <li>
        You then use that "money" to buy the house.</li>
      <li>
        The bank still fractionalizes the promissory note and turns the $100,000 into $900,000.</li>
      <li>
        The bank then pays the taxes on the $900,000. 
      </li>
    </ul>

      "In the United States neither paper currency nor deposits have value as commodities. Intrinsically, as dollar, a dollar bill is just a piece of paper, deposits merely book entries... " - Modern Money Mechanics - Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago - page 3 - Revised 6-1992; and B.), ... and Federal Reserve Notes are valueless. (See IRS Codes Section 1.1001-1 (4657) C.C.H.)</p>
    <p>
      Legal tender under the Uniform Commercial Code (U.C.C.), Section 1-201 (24) (Official Comment), is a concept that sometimes surfaces in cases of this nature.. The referenced Official Comment notes that the definition of money is not limited to legal tender under the U.C.C. Money is defined in Section 1-201 (24) as "a medium of exchange authorized or adopted by a domestic or foreign government and includes a monetary unit of account established by an intergovernmental organization or by agreement between two or more nations." The relevant Official Comment states "... The narrow view that money is limited to legal tender is rejected. " Affidavit of Walker F. Todd, ret legal counsel of the federal reserve bank.
